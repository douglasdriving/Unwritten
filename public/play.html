        <p>Your name is Jenny Falk. You are a 21-year-old Swedish woman who lived all your life in the small town of
            Kvaga. After having spent your 2 years since high-school working at a supermarket and having no idea what to
            do with your life, you have had enough.</p>
        <p>“Kvaga is lame and my life is lame” - you thought to yourself as you quit your job, packed your bags, and
            moved to Berlin to find something new. You had heard a lot about Berlin - that it’s a place filled with
            culture, excitement, parties and interesting people. Without any particular plan about what to do there, you
            are hoping that the city will inspire you. That it will show you new sides of what life has to offer and
            that all that inspiration will enable you to find a new direction.</p>
        <p>On the 18th of May 2014 at 16.03 you arrived at your hostel downtown. Summer is around the corner and the
            city is vibrant. It's a Thursday, which in Kvaga would mean that there is nothing to do. But here, in the
            big buzzing city, you know that you will find something exciting. After having checked in and gotten
            everything in place, you get yourself to the most interesting bar you can find in your area on google maps.
            Time to begin your new life!</p>
