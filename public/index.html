        <h1>Welcome to Unwritten!</h1>
        <p>
            Unwritten is a collaborative writing game in which a community of players writes
            choose-your-own-adventures together. As a player, you get to not only read through stories written by
            others, but also add your own ideas to the world. With time, the world of Unwritten will expand to include
            hundreds of branches and storylines to explore, all created by the players. Join the community and take part
            in the creation of an ever-expanding world!
        </p>

        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to try the current version of Unwritten, you can <a
                href="/pages/createAccount.html?v=0.11">create an account here</a>.
            To play, read the scenarios and choose what action you wanna perform to move forward through the story. If
            none of the existing actions appeals to you, you can always add a new one to branch the story in a new
            direction. Keep playing until you reach an endpoint, and continue adding you own ideas to from there.
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
            Unwritten is currently in an early prototyping stage where weekly updates are sent out to a group of
            playtesters. Feedback from these playtesters is used continuously to improve the game. The current goal is
            to keep expanding and refining the design of Unwritten until it has reached a point where it is ready to be
            packaged and released as version 1.0.
        </p>

        <h2>Give Feedback</h2>
        <p>
            The design philosophy behind project Unwritten is to develop a game by incorporating ideas and opinions from
            the
            community into its design. Therefore, I would be deeply thankful for any feedback that you have on the
            current prototype. Anything you can think of is valuable! Please send your ideas, suggestions, and problems
            related to the game to douglasdriving@gmail.com.
