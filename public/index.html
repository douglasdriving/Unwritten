            Unwritten is a collaborative writing game in which a community of players writes

            in the creation of an ever-expanding world!

            To play the current version of Unwritten, you can <a
                href="/pages/createAccount.html?v=0.11">create an account here</a>.
            To play, read the scenarios and choose what action you wanna perform to move forward through the story. If
            none of the existing actions appeals to you, you can always add a new one to branch the story in a new
            direction. Keep playing until you reach an endpoint, and continue adding you own ideas to from there.
