            Welcome to Unwritten - a collaborative writing game in which a community of players writes
            choose-your-own-adventures together. As a player, you get to not only read through stories written by
            others, but also add your own ideas to the world. With time, the world of Unwritten will expand to include
            hundreds of branches and storylines to explore, all created by the players. Join the community and take part
            in the creation of an ever-expanding world!
            <br><br>
            The game is currently under development, with new updates being released weekly. If you want to try the
            current version, you can <a href="/pages/createAccount.html?v=0.11">create an account here</a>. To
            play, read the scenarios and choose what action you wanna perform to move forward through the story. If
            none of the existing actions appeals to you, you can always add a new one to branch the story in a new
            direction. Keep playing until you reach an endpoint, and continue adding you own ideas to from there.
