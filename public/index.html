            Welcome to Unwritten - a game where the story lies in the hands of the players. Here, you are both a player
            and a creator. Experience a collaboratively written branching narrative and contribute with your own ideas
            to expand the world.
            <br><br>
            To play, read the scenarios and choose what action you wanna perform to move forward through the story. If
            none of the existing actions appeals to you, you can always add a new one to branch the story in a new
            direction. Keep playing until you reach an endpoint, and continue adding you own ideas to from there.
